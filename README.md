# CodePen React Website

This is a simple website built using React.js,javascript,html and css.A CodePen clone app aims to replicate the functionality and user experience of CodePen, a popular online platform that allows users to create, share, and discover HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets in an interactive and collaborative environment. 

## Overview

This website serves as a demonstration of how to build a basic web application using React. It includes several components showcasing various features and functionalities.

## Features

The CodePen clone app typically includes the following key features:

**1** Code Editor: The core component where users can write and edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. It should provide syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and other features to enhance the coding experience.

**2** Live Preview: A real-time preview of the code, allowing users to see the results of their code changes instantly. This is crucial for web development projects, as users can visualize the impact of their code modifications immediately.

**3** Multiple Panes: CodePen usually has multiple panes for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to work on each aspect of their code separately. The clone app should replicate this structure to provide a similar workflow.
